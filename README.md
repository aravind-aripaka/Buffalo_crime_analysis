Problem Description:

Crime prevention is a critical issue for city management, law enforcement, and public safety. This project seeks to analyze historical crime data from Buffalo to uncover trends and patterns, which could be instrumental in understanding crime hotspots, types of incidents, and time-based crime occurrences.

# The objective is to answer the following key questions:

What are the most frequent types of crimes in Buffalo, and how are they distributed across different neighborhoods?
Are there specific days or hours when certain types of crime are more likely to occur?
Can crime trends over the years reveal increasing or decreasing patterns in specific types of incidents?
